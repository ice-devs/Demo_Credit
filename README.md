# Demo Credit

Demo Credit is a MVP (minimum viable product) wallet service which allows users of this service to create a wallet account which can be used to receive loans they have been granted and also send money for repayments.
This service is built using;
- NodeJs
  -  Express.Js framework for backend 
- KnexJs ORM
  -  For database mapping
- AWS
  - Elastic beanstalk for deployment to cloud provisioned EC2 server
  - MySQL RDS
- Typescript 

## Prerequisites
* NodeJs installed

## Installation and Setup 

- Clone the git repo
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/ice-devs/Demo_Credit.git
  ```
- Install dependencies
  ```
  nmp install
  ```
- Environment Script

  A file named `set_env.sh` in the root folder of the project directory has been prepared as an optional tool to help you configure these variables on your local development environment.Edit the variables to your preference then set up environment by running the command below
  > using git bash terminal
    ```
    bash set_env.sh
    ```

  We do _not_ want your credentials to be stored in git. After pulling this project, run the following command to tell git to stop tracking the         script in git but keep it stored locally. This way, you can use the script for your convenience and reduce risk of exposing your credentials.
    ```
    git rm --cached set_env.sh
    ```

  Afterwards, we can prevent the file from being included in your solution by adding the file to our `.gitignore` file.

    ```
